Language Description
-------------------

We have decided to work on a language subset of the C programming language.
Our language accepts a single function defination. Within that function 
variable names can be defined.
Our language also accepts for loop. Other kind of loops are not recognized, nor 
accepted by our language.

The variable name declaration is of the form ```int c;``` Where int is the data type. 
Our language only accepts int and string as data types. 

This is also a language of only a single function. The function can only have 2 parameters,
which can be of only any of the two data types, that is int or string.

The function defination is of the form ```int my_function(int param1, string param2);```
The first int is the return type which can be either int or string. ```my_function``` is an 
identifier, the function name. ```param1``` is an identifier for the first parameter. 
```param2``` is an indetifier of the second parameter.

Identifiers consist only of alphanumeric characters alone. In this langauge only {}():, are 
allowed as special characters.

That is the initial description of our language.

Grammar and BNF
---------------
program -> decList                  //declaration List
declList -> decList decl | decl     //declaration
decl -> varDecl | funDecl           //variable Declaration | function Declaration
varDecl -> typeSpec varDecl
