1. In your groups, identify a programming language for which you will build a compiler. 
To keep the scope manageable, select a small fragment of the language's grammar (tokens and grammar statements). 
Ensure you include at least 4 different token types, 
1 control structure, 2 expression types at a minimum. 
Using BNF and regular expressions, specify the lexemes as well as syntax for your 'mini-language'. 

2. The complexity (or simplicity) of your mini-language will have serious implications on your performance on the compiler construction project 
i.e. too complex, you may not achieve much or complete the project within the semester - 
too simple, you will not be in a position to demonstrate mastery of the requisite competencies, affecting your success rate. Strive for a middle ground!

3. This work is to be done in your groups. However, each student is required to submit the same report individually.
ENSURE YOU INDICATE YOUR GROUP NUMBER AND MEMBERS IN ANY SUBMITTED GROUP WORK. 
Any report submitted without indicating group membership and group members WILL NOT BE GRADED!
